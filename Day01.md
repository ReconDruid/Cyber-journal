# Day 1 – Cybersecurity Journey (2025)
## 🔐 Introduction to Cybersecurity
- Learned about the **CIA Triad**: Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability.
- Explored why cybersecurity matters (e.g., defending against phishing, malware, ransomware).
- Understood the **Red Team vs Blue Team**:
  - Red = Offense (pentesting, ethical hacking)
  - Blue = Defense (incident response, monitoring)
- Discovered **multi-factor authentication (MFA)** stops 95% of brute force/credential stuffing attacks.

## 💻 Hands-On
- Started with **TryHackMe account setup**
- Began learning terminal basics: `ls`, `cd`, `cat`, `ssh`
- Launched Bandit level 0

## 🧠 Reflection
- Realized this field is very hands-on and tactical.
