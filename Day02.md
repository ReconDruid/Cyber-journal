# Day 2 – Cybersecurity Journey
## 🌐 Networking Basics
- Devices use **IP & MAC addresses** to identify themselves:
  - IP = changeable (like your name)
  - MAC = permanent (like a fingerprint)
- Learned difference between:
  - **Public IPs** (internet-facing)
  - **Private IPs** (local devices)
- IPv4 is running out → IPv6 created (2^128 addresses)

## 🔧 Tools & Protocols
- **Ping** = command to test network connection
- Uses **ICMP echo/reply**
- Introduced the idea of network latency, troubleshooting

## 🧪 Hands-On (TryHackMe)
- “What is Networking?” room completed
- Practiced pinging and identifying IP/MAC
- Used commands like `ping`, `ipconfig`, `cat`

## 🧠 Reflection
- Networking is foundational to all future cybersecurity tasks.
