# Day 3 â€“ Cybersecurity Journey
## ðŸšª Ports & Services
- Learned what **ports** are (numbered endpoints for services)
  - Common: 22 (SSH), 80 (HTTP), 443 (HTTPS)
- Introduced **Nmap** for scanning open ports (skipped for now)
- Deep dive into **SSH** â€“ Secure Shell access

## ðŸ§ª Hands-On: Bandit Levels 4â€“5
- Learned to deal with files named with `-` (e.g., `-file00`)
  - Used `./-file00` to bypass shell confusion
- Commands learned: `file`, `cat`, `ls`, `cd`, `exit`

## ðŸ§  Reflection
- Terminal is like a language â€” early syntax is tricky but rewarding
