# Day 4 – Cybersecurity Journey
## 🌐 Continued TryHackMe (Pre-Security Path)
- Completed **“What is Networking?”**
- Started **“Intro to LAN”**, **OSI Model**, and more
- Covered switches, routers, and network architecture

## 💡 Concepts Reviewed
- OSI layers (7-layer model)
- LAN vs WAN
- Packets & Frames: how data moves across devices
- IP routing & subnetting

## 🧪 Bandit (Optional)
- Continued progress on Bandit Level 5+
- Confirmed human-readable files using `file ./-fileXX`
- Used `cat`, `ls`, `cd`, `file` strategically

## 📘 Reflection
- Balancing THM and Bandit is efficient — text gives clarity, Bandit gives grit.
