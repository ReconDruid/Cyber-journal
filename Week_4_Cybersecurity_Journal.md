## 📆 Daily Breakdown

### 🧪 Day 22 – Friday, 11 July 2025  
**Module:** PowerShell Introduction  
- Learned object-based cmdlet structure: `Verb-Noun` format  
- File & directory manipulation: `New-Item`, `Remove-Item`, `Copy-Item`, `Get-Content`  
- Filtering with `Sort-Object`, `Where-Object`, `Select-String`  
- Mini challenge solved: Find largest file in directory  
- Key concept: PowerShell works with **objects**, not plain text

### 😌 Day 23 – Saturday, 12 July 2025  
**Intentional Rest Day**  
- Mental recharge  
- Planned return to PowerShell scripting

---

### ⚙️ Day 24 – Sunday, 13 July 2025  
**Module:** PowerShell (Lab environment)  
- Used `cd`, `Set-Location`, `Get-ChildItem`, `Select-String`, `Sort-Object`  
- Practiced chaining commands with piping (`|`)  
- Gained fluency with object filtering and file traversal  

---

### 🛡️ Day 25 – Monday, 14 July 2025  
**Module:** PowerShell (System Monitoring)  
- Key cmdlets: `Get-Process`, `Get-Service`, `Get-NetTCPConnection`, `Get-FileHash`  
- Matched TCP connections with process owners via `Get-Process -Id <PID>`  
- Reinforced concepts for incident response and basic malware triage  

---

### 🐧 Day 26 – Tuesday, 15 July 2025  
**Module:** Linux Shells & Bash Scripting  
- Checked shell: `echo $SHELL`, viewed: `cat /etc/shells`, switched shells  
- Wrote and tested `.sh` scripts with variables, conditionals, loops  
- Tools: `nano`, `cat`, `chmod +x`  
- Scripts built: `locker_script.sh`, `loop_script.sh`, etc.

---

### 🌐 Day 27 – Wednesday, 16 July 2025  
**Module:** Networking Concepts  
- OSI Model (7 Layers) + TCP/IP Mapping  
- IPv4 addressing, subnets, private IPs, broadcast  
- SSL/TLS & HTTPS in transport encryption  
- Quiz score: 8/10  
- Notable takeaway: Clearer grasp of where each protocol/tech fits in stack

---

### 🔄 Day 28 – Thursday, 17 July 2025  
**Topics:**  
- TCP vs UDP (comparison table, use cases)  
- Encapsulation process (Application to Link Layer)  
- Telnet demos (ports 7, 13, 80)  
- DHCP & DORA process  
- Packet trace shows 0.0.0.0 → 255.255.255.255 pre-IP assignment

---

## 🧠 Weekly Insights
