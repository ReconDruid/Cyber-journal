# 🛡️ Week 1 – Cybersecurity Journey (June 17–24, 2025)

## 📅 Overview
This week marks the beginning of my cybersecurity journey. I committed to studying daily using TryHackMe and other resources, with the goal of mastering core networking and security fundamentals. By the end of the week, I completed the entire **Network Fundamentals** module and began **How the Web Works**.

## 🗓️ Daily Progress Log

### 📘 Day 1 – June 17, 2025
- Learned IP vs MAC addressing
- Public vs Private IPs
- Intro to Ping and ICMP

### 📘 Day 2 – June 18, 2025
- Port basics, protocol association (SSH, HTTP, HTTPS)
- Started Bandit Level 5
- Worked with `file`, `cat`, and hidden files

### 📘 Day 3 – June 19, 2025
- IP addressing and subnetting
- CIDR notation
- Binary math for subnets and hosts
- TryHackMe subnetting module + quizzes

### 📘 Day 4 – June 20, 2025
- More subnetting revision and quizzes
- Reviewed usable host ranges, subnet mask logic
- Worked on binary and decimal conversion

### 📘 Day 5 – June 21, 2025
- ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)
- MAC ↔ IP mapping using ARP requests and replies
- Layer 2-only communication
- Reviewed ARP cache and message structure

### 📘 Day 6 – June 23, 2025
- OSI Model full breakdown
- Encapsulation, data units (bit/frame/packet/segment)
- Layer functions and real-world protocols
- Took quizzes to reinforce concepts

### 📘 Day 7 – June 24, 2025
- UDP/IP vs TCP/IP (reliability, use cases, headers)
- Port ranges and common port numbers (FTP, SSH, HTTP, etc.)
- Port forwarding and router setup
- Stateful vs Stateless Firewalls
- VPNs (PPP, PPTP, IPSec, encryption, tunneling)
- Router vs Switch, Layer 2 vs Layer 3 switching
- VLAN basics and isolation
- Completed the **Network Fundamentals** module

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts Covered
- OSI Model (7 layers)
- IP addressing, MAC addressing
- Subnetting and CIDR
- ARP and DHCP
- TCP vs UDP protocols
- Port numbers and service mapping
- Port forwarding and NAT
- Firewalls (stateless/stateful)
- VPN technologies and encryption
- Routers vs Switches (Layer 2 vs Layer 3)
- VLAN configuration and segmentation

---

## 🧪 Quizzes Completed
- OSI Model: 13/19
- TCP/UDP: 9/10
- Ports and Protocols: 8/10
- Routers vs Switches: 6/10

---

## 💬 Reflections
- Learned a lot this week — heaviest day was Day 7
- Confident in foundational networking concepts
- Still reviewing subnetting and binary math for fluency
- Hands-on tools (ping, cat, find, ssh) helped reinforce theory
- Seeing how everything interconnects across OSI layers and real devices

## 🚀 Next Steps
- Begin **"How the Web Works"** module
- Study HTTP, DNS, browser-server interaction
- Apply networking concepts to web-based attacks and defense
